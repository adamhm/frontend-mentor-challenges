                            bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and
                            have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                            here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                            most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,

                            referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                            job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
